# TIPicross
A game I made for my calculator in Highschool (2012), using TIBasic. My first programming project that I'm quite proud of.

TIPICX.8xp is the main game file
PUZZMAKE.8xp is needed to make your own picross puzzles that you can even trade with other calculators.

The Readable source code is saved as .txt files

It is entirely possible this code will not run unless the user has created certain variables in their calculator. The copy of the game on my old TI-84 that I still use works, if anyone is interested in actually interacting with this software, DM me and I'll help you out.
